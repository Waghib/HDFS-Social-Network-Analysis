# Correlation Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report presents the findings from our correlation analysis of the Pokec social network dataset, focusing on profile completion rates and their relationships with various user characteristics. The analysis was performed using Hadoop MapReduce on a sample of 1,000 user profiles.

## Key Findings

### 1. Age and Profile Completion
- **Correlation Coefficient:** 0.9999
- **Interpretation:** There is an extremely strong positive correlation between age and profile completion
- **Key Insights:**
  - Older users tend to provide more complete profile information
  - This suggests that older users take their online presence more seriously
  - The near-perfect correlation might warrant further investigation

### 2. Gender and Profile Completion
- **Women:**
  - Average completion rate: 49.36%
  - Sample size: 555 profiles
- **Men:**
  - Average completion rate: 39.36%
  - Sample size: 445 profiles
- **Key Insights:**
  - Women tend to maintain more complete profiles
  - The difference is substantial (10 percentage points)
  - This could indicate different approaches to online self-presentation between genders

### 3. Profile Visibility and Completion
- **Public Profiles:**
  - Average completion rate: 46.32%
  - Sample size: 435 profiles
- **Private Profiles:**
  - Average completion rate: 43.83%
  - Sample size: 565 profiles
- **Key Insights:**
  - Public profiles tend to be slightly more complete
  - The difference is relatively small (2.49 percentage points)
  - Users with public profiles may feel more motivated to provide information

## Implications

1. **User Engagement Strategies:**
   - Consider age-specific approaches to profile completion
   - Develop targeted features for different age groups
   - Address the gender gap in profile completion

2. **Privacy Considerations:**
   - The small difference between public and private profiles suggests privacy settings don't strongly influence completion
   - Users might need more education about privacy settings

3. **Platform Development:**
   - Consider implementing age-appropriate profile fields
   - Design features that encourage profile completion across all demographics
   - Develop specific engagement strategies for male users

## Methodology
- Analysis performed using Hadoop MapReduce
- Sample size: 1,000 user profiles
- Metrics:
  - Profile completion percentage based on non-null fields
  - Pearson correlation coefficient for age analysis
  - Average completion rates for categorical variables

## Limitations
1. Sample size limited to 1,000 profiles
2. Profile completion metric based on non-null fields only
3. No consideration of field importance/weight
4. Potential regional biases in the sample

## Next Steps
1. Analyze larger sample size for more robust results
2. Investigate the unusually high age-completion correlation
3. Consider weighted profile completion metrics
4. Analyze temporal trends in profile completion
5. Study interaction effects between variables
